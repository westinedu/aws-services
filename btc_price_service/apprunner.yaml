# AWS App Runner configuration file
#
# This YAML file defines how AWS App Runner should build and run the
# application when deploying directly from source code.  It follows
# the examples for Python services documented in community blogs and
# workshops.  The file uses version 1.0 of the configuration schema
# and specifies Python as the runtime.  Build commands install the
# required packages from requirements.txt, and the application is
# started with `python app.py` on port 8000.  If you choose to
# deploy via a container image instead, this file is optional.
